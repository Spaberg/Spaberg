##  Greetings  🍀

I am a computer scientist with an interest in security and software projects. In my free time, I enjoy activities like game jams, CTFs, and music production. Currently, I am thoroughly enjoying developing a horror game with two friends, allowing us to blend our engineering and artistic skills.
