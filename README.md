##  Greetings  🍀

I am a computer scientist interested in security and software projects. In my free time I enjoy, among other things, game jams, CTFs, and music production. 
I am currently having a blast developing a game called Cattegat with a few friends of mine which combines both my engineering skills and my artistic side.
