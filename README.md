##  Greetings  🍀

I am a computer scientist and ethical hacker with an interest in cybersecurity and game development. In my free time I enjoy activities like game jams, CTFs and music production. Currently, my time is mostly occupied by my master's studies in Computer Systems and Cybersecurity as well as my work as a Teaching assistant at Chalmers University of Technology.

If you think I could be of use in a project or bussiness of yours, or if you just want to discuss ideas, please feel free to reach out. As to how you can contact me, I am sure you can find a way. 😉
