##  Greetings  🍀

I am a computer scientist and ethical hacker with an interest in cybersecurity and game development. In my free time I enjoy activities like game jams, CTFs and music production. Currently, my time is mostly occupied by my master's studies in Computer Systems and Cybersecurity at Chalmers University of Technology, as well as my work as a Teaching assistant.

If you think I could be of use in a project or bussiness of yours, or if you just want to discuss ideas, please feel free to reach out. As to how you can contact me, I am sure you can find a way. 😉
