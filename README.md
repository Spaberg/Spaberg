##  Greetings  🍀

I am a computer scientist interested in security and software projects. In my free time I enjoy, among other things, game jams, CTFs, and music production. 
I'm currently having a blast developing a game called Cattegat. It's a collaborative project which lets us blend both engineering and artistic skills.
